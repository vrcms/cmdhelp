# Continual Learning

Keep `AGENTS.md` current by mining this session's conversation history.

## Inputs

- Current session messages (already in context)
- Existing memory file: `AGENTS.md`

## Workflow

1. Read existing `AGENTS.md`.
2. Review messages from the current session conversation.
3. Extract only high-signal, reusable information:
   - Recurring user corrections/preferences
   - Durable workspace facts (patterns, conventions, tech choices)
4. Merge with existing bullets in `AGENTS.md`:
   - Update matching bullets in place
   - Add only net-new bullets
   - Deduplicate semantically similar bullets
5. Write back to `AGENTS.md` with only these two sections added/updated:
   - `## Learned User Preferences`
   - `## Learned Workspace Facts`

## AGENTS.md Output Contract

- Manage only these sections:
  - `## Learned User Preferences`
  - `## Learned Workspace Facts`
- Use plain bullet points only.
- Do not write evidence/confidence tags.
- Do not write process instructions, rationale, or metadata blocks.
- Maximum 12 bullets per section.

## Inclusion Bar

Keep an item only if **all** are true:

- Actionable in future sessions
- Stable across sessions
- Repeated in the conversation, or explicitly stated as a broad rule
- Non-sensitive

## Exclusions

Never store:

- Secrets, tokens, credentials, private personal data
- One-off task instructions
- Transient details (branch names, commit hashes, temporary errors)
